# Lesson: Instance Vs. Class Attributes
#
# Description: This program demonstrates the difference between instance and
#              class attributes in Python. It defines a `Car` class where
#              `make` and `model` are instance attributes specific to each car,
#              while `wheels` is a class attribute shared by all car instances.
